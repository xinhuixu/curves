    - circle: adds a circle to the edge matrix - takes 4 parameters (cx, cy, cz, r)
    - hermite: adds a hermite curve to the edge matrix - takes 8 parameters (x0, y0, x1, y1, rx0, ry0, rx1, ry1)
        The curve is between points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).
        (rx0, ry0) and (rx1, ry1) are the rates of change at each endpoint
    - bezier: adds a bezier curve to the edge matrix - takes 8 parameters (x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
        This curve is drawn between (x0, y0) and (x3, y3)
        (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the control points for the curve.
